# Private Space / OP15InfinityX priv-app set — status and future work

**Status:** the OP15InfinityX "private-space" / security app cluster is **fully dropped**. No Private
Safe, no Security Centre, no OEM file manager — maximal de-bloat (user decision, 2026-07-03). Nothing is
stubbed; the stub-based accommodation was considered and deliberately abandoned. This file is the
marker + future-work note. It documents intent only; it re-adds no apps and implements no stubs.

Full provenance (origin commits, manifest surfaces, per-app consumer analysis, verification method)
lives in the project evidence doc `privspace-apps-provenance.md` — treat that as the authoritative
reference; this file is the in-tree pointer.

## First drop (v3.5) — three priv-apps

The private-space port (`1fa1bf1 camera: port OP15InfinityX private-space support`) pulled OOS apps into
the build. Three of them are `system_ext` **priv-apps** that request platform privileged permissions
with no allowlist entry. Under `ro.control_privapp_permissions=enforce` (LOS userdebug) the privapp
check turns each into an `IllegalStateException` at `AppIdPermissionPolicy.onSystemReady` →
`system_server` death → hard bootloop. They are OnePlus/OOS private-space + security **bloat**, not part
of AI Unit and not load-bearing for the camera stack, so they were dropped (`5585a11`) rather than
allowlisted (the enforce gate only fires for packages that are present):

- **com.oplus.pantanal.ums** (UMS) — Pantanal "user model service" / decision hub.
- **com.oplus.phonemanager** (PhoneManager) — OOS cleanup/security app.
- **com.oplus.exsystemservice** (OplusExSystemService) — OEM extended-system-service backend.

Absence tolerance proven: v3.3 shipped and ran OplusCamera/Gallery without any of these; the OOS-derived
code paths that reference them hit **caught** `NameNotFoundException` / missing-provider fallbacks and
continue. OplusCamera's Pantanal/UMS FluidCard hooks fail closed benignly.

## Second drop (v4.1) — the four remaining siblings

The user chose maximal de-bloat: drop the whole remaining security/private-space cluster. All four are
removed (apk extract entry + fixups + allowlist/permission-definer surface); the cryptoeng App-Lock HAL
payload is **kept** because the FIDO/cryptoeng device-attestation path (AI-editor cloud) now depends on
it, and `libOplusSecurity.so` is **kept** (base camera blob from the initial port, not part of this
cluster).

- **com.oplus.safecenter** (SafeCenter / Security Centre) — `system_ext/app` (not a priv-app). Crashed
  on camera launch (`NoSuchMethodError` in its own `SecureSafeApp.onCreate` against our oplus-fwk stub).
  The camera queries its provider `content://com.oplus.provider.SafeProvider` (`limit_use_app` check for
  the gallery package) from `GalleryHelper`; that call is **null-checked and wrapped in try/catch** →
  provider absent → null → default path. Fails closed, verified at bytecode. Dropping it removes the
  crash entirely (no oplus-fwk stub needed).
- **com.oplus.encryption** (FileEncryption) — `system_ext/priv-app`; the Private Safe vault. Its one
  platform priv perm (`WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`) allowlist block is removed with the app (clean; the
  enforce gate only fires for present packages). Gallery/FileManager "move to Private Safe" menus degrade
  (v3.3-tolerated).
- **com.oneplus.filemanager** (FileManager) — `system_ext/app` (not a priv-app → zero allowlist/bootloop
  exposure). Functional duplicate of the LOS file manager.
- **com.oplus.securitypermission** (SecurityPermission) — `system_ext/app` (not a priv-app). Its port
  fixup injected the `com.oplus.permission.safe.*` signature-permission family so OEM cross-app guards
  resolved; dropping it un-defines that family → guarded providers become deny-all to external callers =
  the v3.3 semantics (no definer shipped then either), proven benign. Its two genuinely-defined perms
  (`com.oplus.permission.SECURITY_ACTION`, `com.oplus.permission.safe.SMS.BROADCAST`) have no consumer in
  the kept stack.

No sepolicy or hidden-api change is required for the second drop (no cluster-specific types; the four
apps carry no hidden-api whitelist entries). The oplus-fwk `OplusMultiAppManager`/`OPlusAccessControlManager`
stub accommodation for SafeCenter was reverted — no kept app references those members.

## TODO — future "Private Safe" accommodation (deferred, DO NOT build here)

If Private Safe / the OplusCam private-space integration is ever wanted **without** shipping the OEM
bloat backends, the intended path is a minimal **stub surface**, not re-adding the dropped apks. The full
blueprint is captured in `privspace-apps-provenance.md` ("Future: stub-based accommodation"): a
Pantanal/UMS empty-provider stub, an oplus-permission-definer stub for the `com.oplus.permission.safe.*`
family (or smali no-ops in the kept consumers), and — only if a kept app ever hard-depends on it — a
SafeCenter `SafeProvider` empty-cursor stub. Until then: no stubs, no re-added apks.
